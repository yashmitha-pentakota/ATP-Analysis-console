**CONCLUSION**
The development of a centralized dashboard for Fluentgrid is essential to address the growing need 
for consolidated data insights. By incorporating data from all projects, stakeholders will have a 
comprehensive view of the amount of money handled/collected during specific time periods or 
transactions occurring at particular geographical locations. The centralized dashboard, created 
through a systematic approach involving data integration, transformation, visualization, and 
interactive functionality, will enhance data visibility, provide a user-friendly interface, and empower 
stakeholders with valuable insights for decision-making.
